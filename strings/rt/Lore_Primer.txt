	<em> The first and old gods of old times are dead. They hold the truest right to our rightful worship. </em>

		<summary><strong> Orthodox Old God Worship </strong></summary>
		<br>
		The so called old minded. Orthodox worshippers believe that Old gods are the rightful owners of their essence and power for they were the very meaning of their creations. They hold a deep hatred towards The Last Death for his butchery of almost all old gods.

	<details>
		<summary><strong> Progressive Old God Worship </strong></summary>
		<br>
		A schism within the orthodox church, this progressive faction believes that worship is possible through The new gods. And old gods were mad and it was a necessity to slay them before they unmade the universe like they made it, by fighting blindly. But in the end they are the actual gods, not the once mortals riding on their essence, not their offspring such as Last Death.
