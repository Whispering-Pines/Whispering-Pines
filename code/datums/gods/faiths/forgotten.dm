		Uncommon anywhere, as their religion is long gone but may be found through old archives. \n\
		Worshippers have held deep grudges against the Church of new gods for their role in the butchery of their gods. \
		Yet in recent times, there has been a growing schism among Old Godsites regarding the theological implications of new gods."
